# munin-views

A very simple front end for munin graphs, based on bootstrap/jquery and configurable using JSON files.

## Usage
By default, 3 sections are loaded : "Procution", "Acceptance" and "Test".

Each of those section requires a JSON file, named "(production|acceptance|test).json",
which describes the images to load and some attributes.

## Configuration
Edit the json files according to you needs.
